# **JOINS**
- The `JOIN` clause combines rows from two or more tables by joining them together.
- Combination is based on common column values specified using an `ON` condition.

### **INNER JOIN**
- `INNER JOIN` is the default `JOIN` and it will only return results matching the condition specified by `ON`

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employee
INNER JOIN department
ON employee.employee_id = department.employee_id;
```

### **OUTER JOIN**
- An `OUTER JOIN` will combines rows from different tables even if the join condition is not met.
- `LEFT JOIN` combines matches with all rows from the left-side table.
- `RIGHT JOIN` combines matches with all rows from the right-side table.
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` combines matches with all rows from the left and right side tables.

```sql
-- LEFT JOIN:
SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name, employee.age, employee.designation,
department.department_name, department.project
FROM employee
LEFT JOIN department
ON employee.employee_id = department.employee_id

-- RIGHT JOIN:
SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name, employee.age, employee.designation,
department.department_name, department.project
FROM employee
RIGHT JOIN department
ON employee.employee_id = department.employee_id

-- FULL OUTER JOIN:
SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name, employee.age, employee.designation,
department.department_name, department.project
FROM employee
FULL OUTER JOIN department
ON employee.employee_id = department.employee_id
WHERE employee.employee_id IN (7, 9, 12)
```

### **UNION**
- Combine results that appear from multiple `SELECT` statements and filter duplicates.
- `UNION ALL` keep all the duplicates.

```sql
SELECT city, state, zipcode
FROM customers
UNION
SELECT city, state, zipcode
FROM suppliers
ORDER BY city;
```

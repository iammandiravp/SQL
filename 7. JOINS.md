# **JOINS**
- The `JOIN` clause combines rows from two or more tables by joining them together.
- Combination is based on common column values specified using an `ON` condition.
- `PRIMARY` and `FOREIGN` keys play a very important role in performing SQL joins.

### **INNER JOIN**
- `INNER JOIN` is the default `JOIN`. We can also use only `JOIN`.
- `INNER JOIN` returns matching records/rows from both the tables.

```sql
-- ONLY JOIN:
SELECT *
FROM employee
JOIN department
ON employee.employee_id = department.employee_id;

-- INNER JOIN:
SELECT *
FROM employee
INNER JOIN department
ON employee.employee_id = department.employee_id;
```

We can use alias or initials to represent the table names instead of repeating the whole table name for better readability.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employee e
JOIN department d
ON e.employee_id = d.employee_id;
```

### **LEFT JOIN**
`LEFT JOIN` returns all the records from the left table, and matched records from the right table.
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.age, e.designation, d.department_name, d.project
FROM employee e
LEFT JOIN department d
ON e.employee_id = d.employee_id
```

### **RIGHT JOIN**
`RIGHT JOIN` returns all the records from the right table, and matched records from the left table.
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.age, e.designation, d.department_name, d.project
FROM employee e
RIGHT JOIN department d
ON e.employee_id = d.employee_id
```

### **FULL JOIN**
`FULL JOIN` returns all the records when there is match in either table
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.age, e.designation, d.department_name, d.project
FROM employee e
FULL JOIN department d
ON e.employee_id = e.employee_id
```

### **UNION**
- Combine results that appear from multiple `SELECT` statements and filter duplicates.
- `UNION ALL` keep all the duplicates.

```sql
SELECT city, state, zipcode
FROM customers
UNION
SELECT city, state, zipcode
FROM suppliers
ORDER BY city;
```

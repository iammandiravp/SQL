# **SQL**
### **Structured Query Language**
- A programming language designed to communicate with data stored in the **relational database management system**.
- **SQL** syntax is similar to the english language. Which makes it relatively easy to read, write, and interpret.
- **RDBMS** use SQL to access, manage, manipulate, update the data in tables stored in the database schemas.


### **Database**
- A database is a collection of structured information stored so it can be easily accessed and updated.
- In a computer system, databases are commonly accessed through a database management system,

### **Relational Database** 
- A store of structured data organized in tables made up of rows and columns.
- Multiple tables can have relationships based on the values in key columns (Primary or Foreign)
- They provide an efficient and flexible way to access structured information.
- Data is typically queried and manipulated using Structured Query Language (SQL).
- The software that controls a relational database is called relational DBMS.
- Example: MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Azure SQL, etc.

### **ACID Properties**
- ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
- ACID are four key properties that define the reliability and consistency of SQL operations in a DBMS.
- **Atomicity:** All or nothing. Either all the operations are completed successfully or None.
- **Consistency:** The database must remain consistent before and after the SQL operations.
- **Isolation:** SQL operations are independent of one another, and do not interfere with each other.
- **Durability:** SQL operation once completed, is permanent and persists even if a system failure occurs.

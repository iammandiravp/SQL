# **Constraints**
- Constraints in SQL are the rules applied to the values of individual columns.
- They add rules about how a column can be used after specifying the data type for a column.

Constraints | Description
:--- | :---
`PRIMARY` | Columns can uniquely identify the row
`FOREIGN` | Columns can refer to another table to create relationships
`UNIQUE` | Columns have a different value for every row
`NOT NULL` | Column must have a value for every row, no blank or null values will be accepted
`DEFAULT` | Column will assume a value for a row if the value is not specified
`CHECK` | Column check for a predefined condition

```sql
-- Create an employee table:
CREATE TABLE employee(
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(25),
  last_name VARCHAR(25),
  age INT CHECK (age >= 18),
  birthdate NOT NULL DATE,
  designation VARCHAR(20),
  city VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Bengaluru'
)

-- Create a department table:
CREATE TABLE department(
  department_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
  department_name VARCHAR(25),
  employee_id INT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  project VARCHAR(25),
  team VARCHAR(25) DEFAULT 'Apple Inc.',
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employee(employee_id)
)
```

### **Primary Keys**
- Special columns that are used to uniquely identify each row of a table in SQL.
- None of the values can be `NULL`
- Each value must be unique
- `NOT NULL` + `UNIQUE`
- A table cannot have more than one primary key
 
```sql
/* If a table was created without a primary key,
it can be added with the ALTER TABLE command. */

ALTER TABLE employee
ADD PRIMARY KEY (employee_ID);
```
### **Foreign Keys**
- When the primary key for one table appears in a different table, it is called a foreign key.
- The joins will be joining a foreign key from one table with the primary key from another table.
- Example: employee_id is a primary key in the employee table and foreign key in the department table.
- We can join the employee table and department table using the employee_id column.

### **Composite Keys**
- Sometimes, having one primary key per table is not enough to uniquely identify a row.
- In such cases, multiple columns would work as a composite key for the table.
- This requirement should be detected during the designing phase of a database (tables and their relationships)

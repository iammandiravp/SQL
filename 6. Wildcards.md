# **Wildcards**

- Wildcards are special characters used in SQL to represent one or more arbitrary characters.
- `%` matches zero or any arbitrary number of characters.
- `_` matches any or single arbitrary character.
- Some SQL implementation add additional types of wildcards.
- `*` in place of `%` and `?` in place of `_`
- Wildcards are commonly used with the `LIKE` operator.
- Returns TRUE if the wildcard pattern matches with the provided string value.

```sql
-- Return if first_name starts with k:
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE first_name LIKE 'k%'

-- Return if first_name ends with k:
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE first_name LIKE '%k'

-- Return if first_name contains n anywhere:
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE first_name LIKE '%n%'

-- Return if first_name contains u at second position:
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE first_name LIKE '_u%'

-- Return first_name with exactly 5 characters:
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE first_name LIKE '_____'
```

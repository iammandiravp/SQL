# **Wildcards**

- Wildcards are special characters used with the `LIKE` operator in the `WHERE` clause to search for specific pattern in a column.
- `%` matches zero, one or multiple characters.
- `_` matches a single character.
- `[]` matches any single character within the brackets
- `-` Used within brackets to specify a range of characters.
- Some SQL tools uses alternate characters as a wildcard. `*` in place of `%` and `?` in place of `_`
- Wildcards are commonly used with the `LIKE` operator in `WHERE` clause.

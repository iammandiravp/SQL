# **Aggregate Functions**
- Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value.
- They are often used with the `GROUP BY` clause of the `SELECT` statement.

**Note:** Except for `COUNT(*)`, aggregate functions ignore all `NULL` values.

```sql
-- AVG(): Returns the average value in a column.
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM employee
WHERE experience < 5;   

-- COUNT(): Returns the total number of rows that matches the specified conditions.
SELECT year, COUNT(*)
FROM movies
GROUP BY year
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

-- SUM(): Returns the sum of all the value in that column.
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM transactions
WHERE category IN ('Dairy', 'Bread');

-- MAX(): Returns the largest value in a column.
SELECT MAX(age)
FROM employee;

-- MIN(): Returns the smallest value in a column.
SELECT MIN(age)
FROM employee;
```

# **Operators**
- Operators are unique keywords used to perform arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
- They are commonly used in the WHERE clause of an expression.

### **Arithmetic Operators**
```sql
-- Addition (+)
SELECT 10 + 5;

-- Subtraction (-)
SELECT 10 - 5;

-- Multiplication (*)
SELECT 10 * 5;

-- Divison (/)
SELECT 10 / 5;

-- Modulo / Remainder (%)
SELECT 10 % 5;
```

### **Comparison Operators**

```sql
-- Equal to (=)
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE city = 'Bengaluru'

-- Greater than | Greater than or equal to (> | >=)
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE age > 25

-- Less than | Less than or equal to (< | <=)
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE age < 50

-- Not equal to (!= | <>)
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE YEAR(birthdate) <> 1995
```

### **Logical Operators**

```sql
-- AND: Test if all conditions in a given expression evaluate to TRUE.
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE designation = 'Business Analyst' AND age = 26;

-- OR: Test if any condition in a given expression evaluates to TRUE.
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE designation = 'Business Analyst' OR designation = 'Senior Support Executive';
```

### **BETWEEN**
`BETWEEN` operator is used to define and select values within a given range.
```sql
-- BETWEEN: Select values, inclusively of beginning and end values.
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE birthday BETWEEN '2000-12-31' AND '1990-01-01';
```

### **IN**
`IN` operator allows you to specify multiple values with `WHERE` clause.
```sql 
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE city IN ('Bengaluru', 'Mumbai', 'Chennai', 'Pune');
```

### **IS NULL**
`IS NULL` Checks if a value is `NULL`
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE designation IS NULL;
```

### **IS NOT NULL** 
`IS NOT NULL` Checks if a value is not `NULL`
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE designation IS NOT NULL;
```

### **NOT IN**
An expression that return `NOT IN` for some conditions.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE city NOT IN ('Delhi', 'Kolkata', 'Kochi');
```

### **LIKE** 
Returns `TRUE` if text character matches the wildcard pattern.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE first_name LIKE 'K%';
```

### **IF**
Applies conditional logic to queries and returns a value.
```sql
SELECT
first_name, last_name, age
IF(age > 35, 'Senior', 'Junior') AS level,
designation
FROM employee;
```
